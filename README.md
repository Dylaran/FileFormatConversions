# FileFormatConversions
Project for CSE480: Database Systems.

Converts between 3 plain text data representations: CSV, JSON, and XML. 

Reads in code from a given file, saves them into some common internal representation, and outputs them in the desired format. 

Only built in modules of Python 3 were used.
